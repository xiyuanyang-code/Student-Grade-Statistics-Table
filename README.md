# Student-Grade-Statistics-Table

## Introduction

This is an implementation of a student grade statistics table based on structures. In the program, each student is simplified into a structure with an ID number, name, and grades in three subjects. Users can add, modify, and delete student information, as well as print all student information in the list in different orders (chronological order of addition, descending order by total score, ascending order by ID number). It also supports analyzing the average, highest, and lowest scores of all subjects for all students in the list; supports searching for students that meet specific criteria by score, name, or ID number. The instructions for the related menu operations have been written into functions, which users can view at their convenience.
