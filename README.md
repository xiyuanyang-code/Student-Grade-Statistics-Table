# Student-Grade-Statistics-Table

## Introduction

This is an implementation of a student grade statistics table based on structures. In the program, each student is simplified into a structure with an ID number, name, and grades in three subjects. Users can add, modify, and delete student information, as well as print all student information in the list in different orders (chronological order of addition, descending order by total score, ascending order by ID number). It also supports analyzing the average, highest, and lowest scores of all subjects for all students in the list; supports searching for students that meet specific criteria by score, name, or ID number. The instructions for the related menu operations have been written into functions, which users can view at their convenience.

## File Structure

- CMakeLists.txt
- main.cpp
- main.exe
- thestudent.h
- README.md
- LICENSE
- .gitignore

## Usage

run the `main.exe`.

All the source code for the program has been placed in the `main.cpp` and `thestudent.h` file.

## Issues needed to be addressed

- This program involves a dozen or so custom functions and includes over 300 lines of code, with significant redundancy issues., which needs to be simplified.
- This program is implemented using structures and does not yet apply object-oriented programming concepts. It still requires further optimization.
- This is a small project that I independently attempted to complete while self-studying C++. It is currently only the initial version. I commit to improving and optimizing the program after gaining more advanced knowledge, and to implement additional features.
